<strong>One Additional GDOE Employee Tests Positive for COVID-19</strong><br/>
On Monday, September 7, 2020, the Guam Department of Education (GDOE) confirmed that an employee from Harry S. Truman Elementary School tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The GDOE is working closely with the Department of Public Health and Social Services (DPHSS) to conduct contact tracing and close contacts of the confirmed cases will be contacted directly by DPHSS. A close contact is an individual who has come in face-to-face contact with a confirmed COVID-19 individual for at least 10 minutes or more and within six feet, or who has had direct contact with infectious secretions of the confirmed COVID-19 individual (e.g. being coughed on). </p>
<p>Areas of the campus have been identified for cleaning and disinfecting. GDOE employees will not have access to these areas until cleaning has been completed.</p>

<strong>DPHSS Issues Guidance Memo 2020-11 Rev7</strong><br/>
DPHSS issued Guidance Memo 2020-11 Rev7 relative to the quarantine requirements for all persons arriving in Guam. </p>
<p>The following clarification is provided and is applicable to Executive Order 2020-04, 2020-11, 2020-14, 2020-16, 2020-20, 2020-22, 2020-24, 2020-28, 2020-29, 2020-30, and any other Executive Orders regarding entry into Guam and the March 31, 2020, Public Health Directive relative to quarantine of all persons arriving in Guam.</p>
<p>Effective 12:00PM on Friday, August 21, 2020, and to continue for an initial period through 12:00PM on September 11, 2020, Executive Order No. 2020-30, restricting entry into Guam. Pursuant to Section 3333, Article 3, Chapter 3, Title 10, Guam Code Annotated, all persons entering Guam shall be subject to quarantine in accordance with the Department of Public Health and Social Services guidance.</p>
<p>Therefore, as part of Guam’s ongoing effort to contain the spread of COVID-19, all persons entering Guam by air or sea shall be subject to a 14-day quarantine at a Government of Guam Quarantine Facility or approved rental lodging or personal residence.</p>
<p>Individuals permitted to quarantine at their personal residence or rental lodging location must meet certain criteria as contained in this Guidance document – in these instances, individuals must be tested for COVID-19 and receive a negative test result. The Guam DPHSS will accept two types of diagnostic tests which detect the virus – molecular test, such as RT-PCR tests, which detect the virus’s genetic material, and antigen tests, which detect specific proteins on the surface of the virus. These tests identify people who are currently infected with the coronavirus. An antibody (serology) test should not be used to diagnose an active coronavirus infection as antibodies can take several days or weeks to develop after infection and may remain in the blood for several more weeks. </p>
<p>In coordination with the Guam International Airport Authority (GIAA), transiting passengers may be asked to remain in a designated section of the airport facility while awaiting connecting flights less than 13 hours from landing time to departure time. Transiting passengers awaiting connecting flights in excess of 13 hours will quarantine at the Government of Guam Quarantine Facility until they are transported to GIAA to transit off Guam.</p>
<p>All persons are required to fill out a Health Declaration Form upon arrival to Guam. Those who are subject to quarantine restrictions are required to sign a Voluntary Quarantine Acknowledgement. Persons who choose not to sign will be subject to Involuntary Quarantine.</p>
<p>Costs associated with the quarantine and/or treatment for persons who are subject to restricted entry into Guam pursuant to Executive Orders 2020-04, 2020-11, 2020-14, 2020-16, 2020-20, 2020-22, and 2020-24 shall be the responsibility of the individual and the individual’s contracted carrier.  In addition, all damages to assigned property will be the responsibility of the occupant.</p>
<p>Compliance with voluntary quarantine regardless of location is subject to monitoring, verification, and enforcement. The knowing and intentional failure to follow any part of this order constitutes a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment of not more than one year or both (10 GCA, Chapter 19, §19604 (c) Cooperation). </p>
<p>This travel guidance does not apply to individuals identified as contacts to persons with COVID-19.  Contacts will be subject to quarantine based on Guam Department of Public Health and Social Service contact investigation and quarantine protocols as well as CDC’s guidelines, which may extend the quarantine period beyond 14 days.</p>

<div class="container"> <span class="close-content-box">X</span> Flooding is a temporary overflowing of water onto land that is normally dry. Flooding may happen with only a few inches of water, or it may cover a house to the rooftop. There are many possible causes of floods including heavy rain, coastal storms and storm surge, waterway overflow from being blocked with debris, or overflow of levees, dams, or waste water systems. Flooding can occur slowly over many days or happen very quickly with little or no warning, called flash floods. <br/>

<div class="container"> <span class="close-content-box">X</span> Tsunamis, also known as seismic waves (mistakenly called “tidal waves”), are a series of enormous waves created by an underwater disturbance such as an earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption, or meteorite. Earthquake-induced movement of the ocean floor most often generate tsunamis. If a major earthquake or landslide occurs close to shore, the first wave in a series could reach the beach in a few minutes, even before a warning is issued.<br/>
